# Fun-Projects

As someone who is learning Data Science, there is a lot of structured, "on the rails" projects to tackle -- projects where the questions to answer are chosen for, and the path toward a solution is fairly clean. I have some of those type of projects in other repos. This repo is more exploratory. Here, I'm finding projects/questions from communities like Toward Data Science and and other analytics blogs on Medium, and seeing if I can recreate, and put my own spin on, some of the questions they pose.

Part of the goal here is to build some muscle around the data analysis libraries I'm getting exposed to in my coursework. Another, arguably more important part, is starting to build a list of projects where I'm exploring questions that are more ambiguous, less "on the rails", and give me some space to exercise critical thinking and creativity through the medium of code.
